# Design Patterns

This document serves as an overview for the `design-patterns` project.
The main class within this project is responsible for invoking static caller methods of all individual design pattern implementations.
Each design pattern is organized into its own package, allowing for clear separation and easy navigation among the various patterns implemented in this project.

## Structure

- **Main Class**: The entry point of the project, responsible for executing static methods of design pattern implementations.
- **Design Pattern Packages**: Each design pattern is encapsulated within its own package, providing a modular approach to the project structure.

## Usage

To explore a design pattern, navigate to the corresponding package and refer to the static method implementations called by the main class.
This setup facilitates easy addition, modification, and testing of design patterns within the project.
